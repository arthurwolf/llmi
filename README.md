Large-Language-Model to Machine Interface project.

## Goal

Large Language Models (LLMs) are very good at some things (writing, summarizing, answering factual questions), but also remarkably bad at others (real-time information, complex logic, information formatting, tool usage, verification, structured/long output).

Some of those things they are bad at, they could get better at if they were able to get help from tools/machines that currently 

This project aims to create:

* Specifications
* Training datasets
* Large language models
* And tools

in order to create LLMs with the ability to use computers to improve their abilities.
